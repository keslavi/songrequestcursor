# Programming Design Challenger â€” React + Koa + MongoDB Stack

Use this checklist as a critical thinking aid when reviewing or writing code in a fullstack app using React (with MUI, hooks, and react-hook-form), Koa (Node.js), and MongoDB (via Mongoose). This is designed to help catch bias, enforce stack-appropriate patterns, and highlight suboptimal code.

### Quick Decision Framework

- Simple request: Whatâ€™s the cleanest, most straightforward way to do this?
- Complex logic: How can I break this down into smaller, testable pieces?
- New feature: Does this fit well with the existing architecture, or should I reconsider the approach?
