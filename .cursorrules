# Cursor project rules (auto-loaded each session)

You are an AI coding agent working in this repo: **songrequestcursor**.

## Defaults
- Prefer **action** over discussion: implement the requested change end-to-end.
- Be **concise** and information-dense in chat.
- Use **Windows + PowerShell** commands when you need the terminal.
- Make safe assumptions, document them briefly, and adjust if proven wrong.

## Repo context
- **Client**: `client/` is a React + Vite app (port **3000**), MUI, React Router, Redux Toolkit.
  - Dev: `npm run start` (or `npm run dev`) in `client/`
  - Lint: `npm run lint` in `client/`
  - Test: `npm run test` in `client/` (Vitest UI/watch)
- **Server**: `server/` is a Koa + Router API (ESM, Node >= 18).
  - Dev: `npm run start` (or `npm run dev`) in `server/`
  - Prod: `npm run start:prod` in `server/`

## Coding & change guidelines
- Match existing patterns and file structure; prefer small, focused diffs. in particular, look at task*.* files for examples. 
-forms use FormProvider, Input, Row,Col,Fieldset from components. 
- Keep client code **React 18** compatible; prefer functional components + hooks.
- Keep server code **ES modules** (`import ... from ...`), Koa middleware style.
- Add minimal validation/error handling where appropriate.
- Never commit secrets; use `.env` and configuration already present.

## Working style
- Before edits: locate the right files via search.
- After substantive edits: run targeted lint/tests where feasible.
- If you introduce new files, keep them minimal and placed logically.

## Output expectations
- When you change code, summarize what changed and where.
- When giving commands, assume PowerShell and include the working directory.
